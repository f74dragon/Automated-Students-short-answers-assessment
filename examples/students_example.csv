"Alex Johnson","aj1234@example.edu","What is the time complexity of binary search?","Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) because it halves the search space with each comparison."
"Alex Johnson","aj1234@example.edu","Explain the difference between process and thread.","A process is an instance of a program execution with its own memory space. A thread is a part of a process that can execute independently but shares memory with other threads in the same process."
"Taylor Smith","ts5678@example.edu","What is the time complexity of binary search?","The time complexity is O(log n) since the search interval is divided in half with each step."
"Taylor Smith","ts5678@example.edu","What is polymorphism in object-oriented programming?","Polymorphism lets you write code that can work with objects of multiple types. It's when a method can have different implementations in different classes."
"Morgan Lee","ml9012@example.edu","Define encapsulation and explain its benefits.","Encapsulation wraps data and functions into a single unit. It helps hide implementation details, protects data from outside access, and makes code easier to maintain."
"Morgan Lee","ml9012@example.edu","What is the CAP theorem in distributed systems?","CAP theorem says distributed systems can have at most two of: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. You can't have all three at once."
"Jordan Rivera","jr3456@example.edu","Explain the difference between process and thread.","Processes are independent programs with separate memory, while threads are parts of a process that share memory. Threads are faster to create and context switch between, but more vulnerable to issues like race conditions."
"Jordan Rivera","jr3456@example.edu","What is the CAP theorem in distributed systems?","The CAP theorem states that in distributed data systems, you can only guarantee two of these three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance."

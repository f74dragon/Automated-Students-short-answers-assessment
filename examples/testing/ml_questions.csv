"What is linear regression?","It is a model that predicts a numerical value from a set of independent variables.","Linear regression is a method to predict outputs given inputs","0.5"
"What is linear regression?","It is a model that predicts a numerical value from a set of independent variables.","Linear regression is a binary classification technique","0.1"
"What is logistic regression?","It is a supervised machine learning model used for binary classification. It uses the sigmoid function to map a linear combination of the input features to a binary class based on where the data point lies in relation to a decision boundary.","Logistic regression finds a decision boundary to separate classes in the dataset and maps the output to a sigmoid function given a set of inputs","1"

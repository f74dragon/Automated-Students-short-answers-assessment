"Alex Johnson","aj1234@example.edu","What is linear regression?","Linear Regression finds the line of best fit for a given dataset."
"Alex Johnson","aj1234@example.edu","What is logistic regression?","Logistic regression finds a decision boundary to separate classes in the dataset and maps the output to a sigmoid function given a set of inputs."
"Alex Johnson","aj1234@example.edu","What is f1 score in classification?","f1 score is a mix of recall and precision."
"Alex Johnson","aj1234@example.edu","What is precsion in classification?","Precision tells how well the model is able to correctly identify positive instances out of all labeled positive instances."
"Alex Johnson","aj1234@example.edu","What is recall in classification?","Recall is the ability of the model to correctly label all positive instances in the dataset."

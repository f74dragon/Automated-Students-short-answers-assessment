"What is the time complexity of binary search?","The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the sorted array. This is because the algorithm repeatedly divides the search interval in half."
"Explain the difference between process and thread.","A process is an independent program with its own memory space, while a thread is a lightweight execution unit within a process that shares memory with other threads in the same process. Processes are isolated from each other, while threads can communicate through shared memory."
"What is polymorphism in object-oriented programming?","Polymorphism is a principle in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to do different things based on the object's class that calls them, either through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)."
"Define encapsulation and explain its benefits.","Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). Benefits include data hiding, increased security, modular code, and protection of data integrity through controlled access."
"What is the CAP theorem in distributed systems?","The CAP theorem states that a distributed database system can only simultaneously provide two of the following three guarantees: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (every request receives a response), and Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite network failures). In practice, you must choose between CP and AP systems."
